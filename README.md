# Interview Assignment: Account Management Frontend - Level 1

Hi there! üëã

**Spoiler alert! üö®** This is **not** your typical interview test where you spend your personal time and don't get anything back.

Regardless of how your interview process goes, you'll get the following two things:
- A great contribution to your dev portfolio by completing this assignment.
- Feedback on how well you did. The hiring team will use a calibrated evaluation rubric to assess your work, so they can share parts of it with you.

## Before writing any code, **please read this README carefully!** ‚ö†Ô∏è
To save everyone's time, this assignment follows a specific structure which boils down to the following two things:

- Using automated tests to validate your submission.
- Assessing a predefined list of tech competences.

So to avoid wasting your time, please make sure to understand what's expected of your submission. 

If something is not clear, [ask a question](#last-hint-before-starting-%EF%B8%8F).

## How much time you'll need ‚è≥

Try not to spend more than **three hours**. Document everything that you haven't managed to complete.

## Last hint before starting ‚òùÔ∏è

If you get stuck with something (e.g., tests don't pass in the pipeline, etc.), please describe your problem in a new GitHub issue on this repository. A human will help you. ü§ö

## Finally, what you're going to build üëÄ
Your task is to build a Frontend app that integrates with the [Account Management API](api-specification.yml) to create and read account transactions.

## Mockup üß±
Here's a mockup to get the idea of how the Frontend should look.

## Compatibility with the tests üîå
This assignment comes with a predefined test suite. To make your Frontend app work with it please ensure the following (feel free to tweak the UI otherwise):

* There's a form with two input fields: Account ID and Amount. Whenever the form is submitted, a new transaction with the collected data should be created on the server, and the corresponding input fields are cleared. The HTML elements must have the following attributes:
  * Account ID input field: `data-type="account-id"`
  * Amount input field: `data-type="amount"`
  * Form: `data-type="transaction-form"`
* There's a list of the previously submitted transactions. Every newly submitted transaction should appear at the top of the list. The HTML element that represents a transaction should include the following HTML attributes: `data-type=transaction`, `data-account-id={transaction-account-id}`, `data-amount={transaction-amount}`, and `data-balance={current-account-balance}`

## Boilerplate üóÇ
We've added the [Account Management API](api-specification.yml) specification defined in the Open API format, a backend service that implements this API, and an automated Cypress test suite. 

To run the tests, first update the `baseUrl` (where your Frontend runs) in [cypress.json](cypress.json) and run your app.

Then to spin up the Backend and run the tests:
```shell script
yarn install # Install the required test dependencies
yarn run start:backend # Spin up the backend
yarn run test # Run the tests
```

## The assessment areas üö©
- **Integrate with a REST API**. Using the provided API spec, figure out the right service endpoints to use.
- **Implement client-side form data validation**. The API has restrictions on the allowed data format. Make sure to do the required checks client-side before sending the data to the server.
- **Organize your code with components**. Extract components that help you avoid duplication, but don't break things apart needlessly. We want to see that you can implement the UI with sound HTML semantics.
- **Document your choices**. Extend this README.md with info about how to run your application along with any hints that will help us review your submission and better understand the decisions you made.

## How to submit your solution üì¨

1. Update the `baseUrl` (where your Frontend runs) in [cypress.json](cypress.json).
2. Update the [`build:frontend`](package.json#L5) and [`start:frontend`](package.json#L6) scripts in [package.json](package.json) that respectively build and run your application. **[See examples](examples.md)**.
3. Commit and push your changes to a new branch called `implementation`. A new [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart) run will trigger automatically based on the [predefined pipeline](.github/workflows/tests.yml). The pipeline will run the `build:frontend` and `start:frontend` scripts from above to spin up your application and run the predefined Cypress tests against it. In case you want to troubleshoot a particular pipeline run, you can access both the video and the screenshots taken by the [upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact#where-does-the-upload-go) GitHub action.
4. Make sure your latest build has succesfully passed (you should see a green checkbox in GitHub).
5. Create a Pull Request from `implementation`.

## What to expect next üí°
1. An engineer will do a code review of your Pull Request. They might ask questions that you'll need to answer, so please watch for GitHub notifications in your mailbox.
2. In the end, the engineer who did the code review will merge your Pull Request. That's when your assignment is over.

## FAQ ‚ùì
- Q: What resources am I allowed to use?
  - A: This assignment simulates a real-world engineering task, so feel free to use any resources you'd typically use.
- Q: How much time should I spend?
  - A: Try not to spend more than **three hours**. Document everything that you haven't managed to complete.
- Q: What if I get stuck?
  - A: Feel free to create a GitHub issue on this repository describing your problem.
