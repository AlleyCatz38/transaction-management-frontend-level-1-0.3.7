Hi there! üëã

In this interview assignment, you'll build a frontend that integrates with the following [Account Management API]().

## UI Mockup
![Mockup](mockup.png)
## Predefined test suite ‚öôÔ∏è

In this repository, there is a predefined test suite that validates the minimum assignment criteria.

Run with:

```
npm install --save-dev puppeteer pptr-testing-library
#TODO spin up the backend.
#TODO run the tests.
```

## What you should focus on ‚ö†Ô∏è

The goal of this assignment is to assess your knowledge in the following areas:

- Integrating with a REST API.
- Maintainable & well-tested code (Organize and test your code similar to how you'd do it in a real production codebase).
- Documentation (Make sure to outline the code structure, and any other technical decisions you would document in a real project).
- Handling state

## How you submit your solution üì¨

1. Create a new branch called implementation and commit all your changes there.
2. Save an output file of a succesful test run for `{test_filename}` under ./out/.
3. Push your changes to the remote repository.
4. Create a Pull Request from `implementation` to `master`.

## What to expect next üëÄ
1. An engineer will do a code review of your Pull Request. They might ask questions that you'll need to answer, so please watch out for GitHub notifications in your mailbox.
2. In the end, the engineer who did the code review will merge your Pull Request. That's when your assignment is over.

## FAQ ‚ùì
- Q: What resources am I allowed to use?
  - A: This assignment simulates a real-world engineering task, so feel free to use any resources you'd typically use.
- Q: How much time do I have?
  - A: Based on our data, 3 hours should be enough to complete this assignment for someone who's seen it for the first time. Anyway, we'd appreciate it if you submitted your implementation within 7-days since you received your invite.
- Q: What if I get stuck?
  - A: Feel free to create an issue on this repository describing your problem.
